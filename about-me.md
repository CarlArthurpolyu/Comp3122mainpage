# About me
I'm Carl Arthur from Sweden. I'm a 4th year engineering student within IT, doing a master degree in AI and Machine Learning. I am now doing an exchange semester at the hong kong polytechninc university. I have also been working as a teaching assistant at the Swedish university Linköping University in some courses I have studied. 

# My skills
My main interest lieas in data handling and analyzis. Therefore my skills in system development are small, while I hold experience in R and Python mainly. Also hold some expereince in java. I want to use data and machine learning to provide values within companies

# My projects
I did a bachelor project in a cyber security project, using ML techniques to analyse there performence on log data for online and offline anomaly detection. The results showed how online anomaly detection is a field that needs further development, while offline anomaly detection hold high f1 scores and performs really well. 

I also have an ongoing project where i analyze my running data from strava, aiming to use machine learning techniques to predict my marathon time and gain insights into how i can improve my running based on different parameters
